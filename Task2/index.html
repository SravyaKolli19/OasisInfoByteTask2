        <p class="about-p1">
          Passionate about web development, I am currently a 3rd-year BTech
          student, dedicated to exploring and mastering the endless
          possibilities that the digital world offers. My academic journey has
          been peppered with hands-on projects, equipping me with a robust
          foundation in modern web technologies. I have a keen interest in
          front-end development. I thrive on the challenge of creating seamless,
          user-friendly experiences and am particularly driven by the
          ever-evolving landscape of web technologies. HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          React, and Node.js are my playground, where I constantly experiment to
          push the boundaries of what's possible. My approach to web development
          is rooted in a dedication to continuous learning. Every obstacle is an
          opportunity to grow, and every line of code is a step closer to
          creating something remarkable. I am a firm believer in collaborative
          work and enjoy engaging with the developer community to share insights
          and gain new perspectives. Looking forward, my aspiration is to
          contribute to impactful projects that enhance user experiences and
          drive innovation in technology. Whether it's developing dynamic
          websites, optimizing performance, or ensuring the integrity of a
          scalable application, I am committed to building solutions that stand
          out. Always open to connecting with like-minded individuals, learning
          from industry veterans, and exploring opportunities that challenge and
          inspire. Letâ€™s connect or discuss potential projects where we can
          create something amazing together!

          <h2 class="h3">WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
          <p>
            Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of
            websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing,
            web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an
            application that works over the internet

        <div class="skills-card">
          <h2 class="h3">FRONT-END DESIGN</h2>
          <p>
            Front-end development is the process of building components that
            interact with users. Examples are the user interface, buttons,
            user-entered data, websites, and user experience (UX) features.

          <h2 class="h3">RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN</h2>
          <p>
            Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approach that
            creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on
            the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it.

          <h2 class="h3">FRAMEWORKS</h2>
          <p>
            A development framework is a set of tools, libraries and conventions
            that enable developers to create applications more quickly and
            efficiently. Development frameworks provide structures and templates
            for organizing application code and files, as well as common
            features such as database management, user input validation, user
            session management and security.

          <h2 class="h3">TIME MANAGEMENT</h2>
          <p>
            Time management is the process of organizing and planning how to
            allocate your time between different tasks and activities. It allows
            you to work smarter, not harder, leading to greater productivity and
            reduced stress.
